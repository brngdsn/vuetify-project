# Vuetify Meteorites

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build the project for production.

### Provisions

```bash
nvm use && yarn
```

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300):

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

Once the build process is completed, the application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.

For this case, since the intended production environment is reverse proxied with nginx, you'll want to move the `dist/` to `saphire/` to accomodate the proxy:

```bash
mv dist/ saphire/
```

Then you can serve it, e.g., with `pm2` and `serve`:

```bash
pm2 start server.js --name ooo-very/saphire
```
